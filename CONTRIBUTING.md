## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and use SwiftLint for enforcement.

#### Key Points:

- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Access Control**: Use the most restrictive access level possible
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs with triple-slash comments
- **Error Handling**: Use proper Swift error handling, avoid force unwrapping
- **Concurrency**: Use Swift's modern concurrency features (async/await, actors)

#### Example:

```swift
/// Manages the build server context for an Xcode project
public actor BuildServerContext {
    private let projectURL: URL
    private var buildSettings: [BuildSettings]?
    
    /// Initializes a new build server context
    /// - Parameter projectURL: The URL of the Xcode project or workspace
    public init(projectURL: URL) {
        self.projectURL = projectURL
    }
    
    /// Loads the project configuration and build settings
    /// - Throws: `BuildServerError` if the project cannot be loaded
    public func loadProject() async throws {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep BSP protocol, JSON-RPC, and Xcode integration separate
2. **Thread Safety**: Use actors for shared mutable state
3. **Error Handling**: Define specific error types, avoid generic errors
4. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all public APIs
5. **Documentation**: Document complex algorithms and protocols

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(bsp): add support for build target dependencies

fix(jsonrpc): handle malformed requests gracefully

docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Integration Tests

- Test BSP protocol compliance
- Test Xcode integration with real projects
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test
swift test --filter TestClassName.testMethodName

# Run with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```
