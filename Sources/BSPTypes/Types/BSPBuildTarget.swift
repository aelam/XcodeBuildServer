/// Build target contains metadata about an artifact (for example library, test, or binary artifact).
/// Using vocabulary of other build tools:
/// - sbt: a build target is a combined project + config. Example:
///   - a regular JVM project with main and test configurations will have 2 build targets, one for main and one for
/// test.
///   - a single configuration in a single project that contains both Java and Scala sources maps to one BuildTarget.
///    - a project with crossScalaVersions 2.11 and 2.12 containing main and test configuration in each will have 4
/// build targets.
///   - a Scala 2.11 and 2.12 cross-built project for Scala.js and the JVM with main and test configurations will have 8
/// build targets.
/// - Pants: a pants target corresponds one-to-one with a BuildTarget
/// - Bazel: a bazel target corresponds one-to-one with a BuildTarget
///
/// The general idea is that the BuildTarget data structure should contain only information that is fast or cheap to
/// compute
